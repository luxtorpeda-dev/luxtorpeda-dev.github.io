# JoyPixels Awesome

### (Formerly EmojiOne Awesome)

### How to use

In the same vein as Font-Awesome, JoyPixels Awesome is for front end developers who just wanna drop an emoji on a page without using any sort of script.
It uses human-friendly class names (based on emoji shortcodes).


```
<!-- Coffee Emoji -->
<i class="jpa-coffee"></i>
```

Additional classes let you modify size:

```
<!-- Coffee Emoji (small) -->
<i class="e1a-coffee jpa-sm"></i>

<!-- Coffee Emoji (medium) -->
<i class="jpa-coffee jpa-med"></i>

<!-- Coffee Emoji (large) -->
<i class="jpa-coffee jpa-lg"></i>

```

### How to generate mapping

```
cd lib/joypixels-awesome
node generate.js

```

### How to compile SCSS

Once you've generated the mapping you can build the css files via grunt.
The compiled styles are output into /extras/css/joypixels-awesome.css

```
npm install grunt grunt-contrib-sass
grunt sass
```
Or from the root of the emoji-toolkit repository you can run the following commands.

```
npm install
npm run grunt sass
```
